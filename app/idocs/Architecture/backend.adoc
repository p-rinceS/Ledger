# Backend Architecture


The backend architecture of Ledger will consist of the following:



1. We will be fetching the data from IGDB Api in Java and storing it in a MySQL database.

2. We will be using Spring Boot to create a RESTful API to fetch the data from the database. Or maybe GraphQL... haven't decided.

3. We will be using Spring Security to authenticate the users.
(no authentication yet.)

4. We will be creating a frontend in React to display the data fetched from the Database.

5. We will be using Docker to containerize the application.
